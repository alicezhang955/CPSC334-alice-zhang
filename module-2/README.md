# Overview
The script threemodes.py uses input from the switch and joystick to print to console. The button input is used to switch between modes.

# User Instructions
Turning the switch on will continually print "sw on". Similarly, toggling the joystick to the left will print "joystick left". Neither switch off nor joystick in neutral or right will print anything. Pressing the button will print "State changed!" and subsequently change the state.

# State Details
Each state will print the text differently.
State 0: "sw on"; "joystick left"
State 1: "sW oN"; "jOyStIcK lEfT"
State 2: "SW ON"; "JOYSTICK LEFT"
