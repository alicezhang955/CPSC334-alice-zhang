## Overview
The device consists of two pieces: a controller and a speaker. These communicate through wifi using ESP-NOW. The controller includes a gyroscope sensor, which sends roll and pitch data to the speaker. The speaker then translates the gyro data into tone. This was done by hard code mapping the gyro ranges to music notes ranging from C3 to C4. The speaker has two audio speakers, one playing tone corresponding to roll and the other corresponding to pitch. The two of these are played in unison, meaning you can create different intervals by tilting the controller at different angles. The controller also has a strip of copper at the edge of the pouch opening, which can be used to turn off the speaker corresponding to the pitch sensor. In other words, you can press on the copper strip to isolate one voice to aid in ~artistic expression~.
